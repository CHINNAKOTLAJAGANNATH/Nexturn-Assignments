    - ID (Unique Identifier)
    - Name (Product Name)
    - Description (Product Description)
    - Price (Product Price)
    - Category (Product Category)
- The system should be able to:
    - Add a new product.
    - Update an existing product.
    - Delete an product.
    - Get a list of all products.
    - Get details of a specific product.
- Add Filtering and Sorting Functionality to the API:
    - Filter products by category.   E.g., http://localhost:8080/products?category=Electronics
    - Filter products by name.         E.g., http://localhost:8080/products?name=Mobile
    - Sorting of products by price.   E.g., http://localhost:8080/products?sort=asc, http://localhost:8080/products?sort=desc
